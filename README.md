# hrtimerpp
A high resolution timer for Linux systems written in C++.

This library provides a class based interface for high resolution timers for C++. The goal is to have a usable set of class for the needs of time measuring and statistical analysis for series of an arbitrary number of measurements.

This code respects the version numbering system "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0", as described here: [semver.org](http://semver.org/)

## Requirements
* Linux kernel (Version >= 2.6)
* CMake (Version >= 2.8)
* Doxygen (Version >= 2.9), for documentation

## Roadmap
* statistical analysis for Timerseries
* Export of Timer and Timerseries
* Import of Timer and Timerseries
* Multilap timer
* Timerseries for multilap timer
